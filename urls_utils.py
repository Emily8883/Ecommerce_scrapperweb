URLs Utilities - urls_utils.py

Author      : Breno Farias da Silva
Created     : 2026-04-06
Description :
    Small utility module that provides helper functions for preprocessing
    lists of URL strings (for example, lines read from Inputs/urls.txt).
    The primary utilities are:

    - `strip_whitespace_and_filter(urls)`: strip leading/trailing whitespace
      and remove empty entries.
    - `remove_dash_prefixes(urls)`: remove leading "- " or "-- " prefixes
      commonly used to mark or comment-out lines.
    - `sort_urls(urls)`: return an alphabetically sorted copy of the list.
    - `preprocess_urls(urls)`: convenience wrapper that runs the above
      steps in the recommended order.

Usage:
    from urls_utils import preprocess_urls
    cleaned = preprocess_urls(raw_lines)

Returns:
    Processed list of URL strings ready for downstream scraping.

Dependencies:
    - Python standard library: `re`

Notes:
    - Functions are pure and return new lists instead of mutating inputs.
    - Keep the helpers small and composable so they are easy to test.
